# Trolley Problem

This project creates a simulation of the _Trial By Trolley_ board game. Each card is assigned a weight, allowing the system to calculate a value for each track, thus determining which track is more worht saving. The system is loosely based on the Doctrine of Double Effect, which is a basic set of moral guidelines that has been extended to form many western philosophies.

In order to run the project, just run the **trolleySolver.py** file and follow the instructions in the console.

If you want to use your own moral weigts, you can edit the weight values, or swap out the card files with your own. The filenames must be the same for the project to run.
