# TrollyProblem

This project intends to formalize the trolly problem into second order logic. Then we will use *shadowprover* to automaitcally construct proofs about which track is the morally correct one to pick based on a set of moral codes. The moral codes that we choose in this project do not reflect the morals of the project members, and were chosen due to thier relateively common use.

We are likely to pick either confusionism or doctrine of double effect(just war theory?)
